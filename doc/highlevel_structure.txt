Use-Time:
  Main-Tool (gb2rpg.exe) that has simple CLI.
  1) Create RPG Maker Project:
    - Requires some RPG Maker 2003 project files (RPG_RT.exe,...).
    - Create Map.emu (XML) from use specified .gb File (input).
    - Create RPG_RT.emt (XML, Maptree).
    - Create RPG_RT.edb (XML).
    - Use lcf2xml to convert these to lcf format in the project/rpg2k3 folder.
    => Put these Files into "project/"

  2) Run C++ Project:
    - Run the CppRPGEnv.
    
  3) Run RPG Maker 2003 Project:
    - calling RPG_RT.exe "project/rpg2k3"

  4) Run EasyRPG Project: 
    - calling EasyRPG.exe in "project/rpg2k3"

Build-Time:
  1) Build C++ environment:
    - Compile emu C++ code into static library.
    - Compile SFML into static libraries.
    - Compile CppRPGEnv into executable (using Emu Code).
  
  2) Build CppEC compiler:
  
  3) Compile emulator C++ code:
    - Into .xml format to be used for EasyRPG and RPG Maker Projects.
  
  4) Compile gb2rpg:
  
  5) Compile lcf2xml:

  6) Compile EasyRPG Player:

  7) Compile rpg2k3-gb:
    - Main CLI for project.
  
Debug-Time:
  1) Debug in C++ Runtime.

  2) Debug in Easy RPG.

Tools:
  - rpg2k3-gb: main CLI
    - list of tools to run easily to create everything you need.

  - gb2RPG: 
    - creates map from .gb file.
    - creates maptree.
    - creates database.
      - can additionally specify common event file (my code).
    - generate the project folder structure.
      - output C++ Project.
      - output EasyRPG Project.
      - output RPG Maker 2003 Project.
  
  - CppEC: C++ Event Compiler
    - Compile C++ code to common events.
  
  - CppRPGEnv: C++ RPG Maker Environment
    - C++ Runtime that mimicks the RPG Maker API and uses SFML.

Required RPG Maker Files:
  - RPG_RT.exe, RPG_RT.ini, *.r3proj, ultimate_rt_eb.dll.
