To corretly use the emulator multiple proprietary files are required. These need to be generated from RPG Maker 2003. You can acquire the RPG Maker 2003 from steam:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/362870/RPG_Maker_2003/

Create a new Project in RPG Maker 2003.
Then copy the following files into this folder:
RPG_RT.exe
ultimate_rt_eb.dll
