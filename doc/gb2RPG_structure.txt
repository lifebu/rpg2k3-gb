gb2RPG: Gameboy 2 RPG Maker.
    - creates map from .gb file.
    - creates maptree.
    - creates database.
      - can additionally specify common event file (my code).
    - generate the project folder structure.
      - output C++ Project.
      - output EasyRPG Project.
      - output RPG Maker 2003 Project.


- TODO:
    - Need to provide the EasyRPG/RTP replacement.
        - Just copy it into the project?
        - EasyRPG/RTP does not work correctly.
        - It does use different names for the RTP.
        - Change base templates to use Local files not RTP? Can I use RTP myself?
       
    - Implement more Robust Error Checks.

    - Better includes in core:
        #include "src/core/lcf/Switch.h"
        =>
        #include "core/lcf/Switch.h"

    - Once I'm done with the refactor do additional passes for code quality for example moving instead of copying (use my Short-Version.yml: Coding Task Checklist ).

    - stop using: "using namespace gb2rpg"
        => better to read if you know the namespace.

    - Unit tests:
        - Using Catch2.
        - Integrate Unit tests into CMake!

    - Create the "FromFile()" Functions later!
        => Can really test them by generating the file (ToFile) and then loading them again (FromFile)!

    - lcf uses:
        - GB2RPG: instantiate high level file class, fill it and then use 
            - Serializer::ToFile(): Database, MapTree, Map.
        - GB2RPG: Insert multiple middle level file classes fomr a file: Common Events (from compiler), Event Commands (Template ROM Code, DMGROM). 
            - Serializer::MultipleFromFile()
        - CRPGEnv: Load High level file class using 
            - Serializer::FromFile(): Database, MapTree, Map.
        - Compiler: Generate multiple middle level file classes to a File: 
            - Common Evvents: for Emulator Code.
            - for symmetry: Event Commands (Template code generation?)
            Serializer::MultipleToFile()

        - CRPGEnv: Update the folowing data while Running:
            Database: Character Stats (Exp, etc), Character Equipment, Variable/Switch values
            Map: Event Positions.

    - Project File Data and Serializer (for file generation, compiler and Runtime):
        - Idea:
            - Serialization:
                - Not every data type needs a Import and Export function. Some only need import!
                Import:
                    - Load all necessary data from the file and place it into a in-memory representation and close the file. 
                    - Not all data is needed for what I want to manipulate, only parse that.
                Export:
                    - Save all the data from the class into the file. 
                    - Load the template for the data.
                    - Replace data with members from class.
                    - Save template again.
                    - Basically the export here does similiar thing to Map generation.
                   
            - Data (Switch.h, Event.h):
                - ONLY: an in-Memory representation of ONLY the data I need to change for my software.
                - e.g. Map: only have the list of events, the rest is never touched.
                - These should be non-copyable, only moveable.

        - To-DO:       
            - Implement Serializer and Data Rework Structure.

            - Implement MultipleFromFile():
                - For database common events generation.
                - For map to insert event commands (map ROM and DMG Rom)


            - Find a way to use partial serializers that does not expose the underlying library (tinyxml2::XMLDocument).

            - Do I need the getters/setters everywhere?
                - Expose less of the inner working of the Database class (getter/setter) and think more about how it will actually be used.

            - Can I try to not use friend class?          
            


            - Most of the Datatypes are not shared. For example switch, variables, characters, items and common events are only used by the Database file => Can add the class declarations in Database.h and not in so many header files.
                - The only thing that is actually shared is a eventcommand.
                - If the definition is inside of the Database class can switches etc. just be POD types instead of classes? (No need for getters/Setters).

            - Only have db serializer public in a header (the only thing I need is toFile/FromFile for that).
                - The rest (item, switch, char, common event etc.) is private in the db serializer.
                - Makes less files and makes the tinyxml2 forward decleration in the internal types (switch) Hidden.
                - Similiar for Map and MapInfo.
                - makes the tinyxml2::XMLDocument returnvalue hidden!
                - I could organize the serializers of private in namespaces instead of a whole class. (Because they are static anyway, and cannot be initialized).
            
            - Map::setupMapRomHeader, setupMapRomLabel:
                - Do I want to load the template file and change every parameter, or just generate it on the fly?
                - They should later create it and return it!      
                      

        - Write Functions for setting/generating event-commands of different types.
            - 
            - set/copy/generate ...
            - setCommandParams
                !- GENERAL Function. (element and argument list)
                ALSO:
                    - Create other functions that build on top of that which have types for the parameters.
                    - setConditionalBranchParams etc.
                    - also need Typedefs (enums?) for the paramters, so that I do not punch in magic numbers.
            - setEventIDNameCoord
            - Libraries of Functionality that allows me to manipulate event-commands.
            - should work ontop on the tinyxml2 library and changes I do to that.

        - Event-Generation and Manipulation can be made more general.
            - factory pattern???
            - Map::generateDMGROM(), generateMapRAM() and generateMapROM() are structurely very similar:
                - generate code for event-page
                - insert code in event-page
                - setEventPageID()
                - insert event-page into event
                - setEventIDNameCoord()
                - insert event into map.
            - could be more generalized.
                - maybe not one function but certain sub-functions?
            - But I do not know yet how compiler will need to work and how it uses it.
            - Event-Manipulation is similar for Map and Compiler.
    
    - RPGHelper:
        - The functions should be in a namespace.
        - Need a better place for all the functions.

    - Memory Leak?:
            //TODO: calling DeepClone/ShallowClone creates a leak somehow (?)
            /*
            // Total: 180kB
            int a = 10;
            {
                tinyxml2::XMLDocument map;
                map.LoadFile(TEMPLATES::MAP);
                tinyxml2::XMLDocument t;

                // Total 2.716kB

                // Creates 2.656, New Total: 5.372kB
                auto* copy = map.RootElement()->DeepClone(&t);
            }
            // Total: 240kB, 60kByte Leaked: 
            int b = 10;
            */
    

    - Performance:
        - 2 MByte Cartidge: 16GB RAM, 2m20s, 1.6GB XML File.
        - Loading the 1.6GB XML file takes up 14.1GB RAM and When Creating it I use up over 16GB!
        - Resulting Binary File is: 95,4 MByte.

        - less memory usage:
            - quick solution:
                - I set BYTES_PER_VAR to 3 to reduce it from 16GB to 6GB and a 550MB .xml files instead of 1.6GB.
                - More like a workaround for now.

            - shortterm solution:
                - can use https://libexpat.github.io/
                    https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat
                    this is what lcf2xml uses. 
                    - stream-oriented XML parser.
                    - good if files are too large to fit into RAM.
                - lcf2xml only requires 600mb of memory in comparison to tinyxml2's 16GB!
                - lcf2xml only takes 44 seconds in comparison to my 2m20s (but it's task might be simpler!).

            - longterm solution:
                - directly work on the binary file.
                    - 1.6GB of XML (MAP.emu for 2MB ROM) equals 95,4MB of Binary format (.lmu).
                    - Can I find a comprehensive RPG Maker file structure reference?
                    - Even the CPP Project could use the binary files, If I create my own library, or use certain elements from easyRPG.
        
        - I could multithread parts of the map generation as it can take a long time.
            - Generating the Mapfile for Pokemon Red takes 2m20s for a 2 mByte Cartridge. 
            - Each Thread is responsible for multiple Event pages (when reading cartridge).
            - Even with Tetris (32 kByte) and 3.000Bytes/Page I could have ~11 Threads in parallel!.
        
        => Binary File + Multithreading:
            - Do not need to stitch together or stream the XML file.
            - Binary file are at max 100mb => keep it just in memory.
            - Have a list of std::vector<EventPage>. Each thread fills one of those vectors.
            - Then just write the binary file for each event.

        - read ROM-Size and RAM-Size.
        - later: Title (to show in RPG Maker!)
    
    - Create Map File:
        - load map-template

        - add DMG-ROM Event:
            => Create my own DMG-ROM in C-Code similar to Emulator C-Code.
                => good test for emulator.
                => better from a legal standpoint than to use actual DMG-ROM.
                => so this event is different to the other events. Actual logic.
            
            - use event template.
            - Read DMG_ROM.cpp file.
            - use CEC to compile into .xml
            - create an Event to the map with .xml as code.
            
        - add MAP-ROM Events: (Cartridge-ROM)
            - read from actual .gb file (input).
            - use event template.
            - use rom-size:
            - code:
                - Code is binary jump.
                Header:
                    ByteOffset = ByteOffset / BYTES_PER_VAR
                    LabelID = ByteOffset
                    LabelID += 1
                    JumpToLabel numLabels / 2;
                Label-Boilerplate:
                    Label X
                    if (LabelID < X)
                        JumpToLabel X - (min(X, 1.000 - X) / 2)
                    if (LabelID > X)
                        JumpToLabel X + (min(X, 1.000 - X) / 2)
                    READVAR1 = LABELXVALUE1
                    READVAR2 = LABELXVALUE2
                    EndEventProcessing


        - add MAP-RAM Events: (DMG-RAM)
            - 500 by 500 map.
            - use event template.
            - Add empty events. Only Thing I need is position.

        - write output .xml file.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into mapfile.

    - Create Maptree File:
        - I think I don't need to change the template. should work like that.
        - if I want to support multiple gameboy games and mapfiles later I might need to change it.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into maptreefile.

    - Create Database File:
        - load database-template.
        
        - add CHARA-RAM:
            - add items:
                - use item template.
                - create 9216 items.
                - item-id defines which item type it is.
            
            - add characters:
                - use character template.
                - create 2966 characters.

        - add EMU Code:
            - load the emu-code .xml (if available)
            - copy:
                common events, switches, variables to database.

        - write output .xml file.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into databasefile.
    
    - Create project folder:
        - folder structure (empty folder):
            - Title, System2, System, Sound, Picture, Panorama, Music, Movie, Monster, GameOver, Frame, FaceSet, ChipSet, CharSet, BattleWeapon, BattleCharSet, Battle2, Battle, Backdrop
        - copy compiled data:
            mapfiles (Map0001.lmu,...), maptree (RPG_RT.lmt), database (RPG_RT.ldb)
        - copy required data:
            RPG_RT.ini, *.r3proj, ultimate_rt_eb.dll, RPT_RT.exe
