GB2RPG: Gameboy 2 RPG Maker.
    - .gb   => MAP-ROM + MAP-RAM as .xml => mapfile. 
            => DB-RAM as .xml => databasefile.
            => Emu-Code as .xml => databasefile.
            => creates the entire RPG Maker project.


- TODO:
    - Features:
        - GBFILE:
            - Do not return filestream, but create a function that returns x-Bytes.
            - Need to get and peak bytes!
        - Once Map breaks MAPROM generation early by using GBFILE EOF, the last ROM-Page will be incomplete.
            - It will need less total number of labels.
            - use: NumOfLabels = (MEMORYSIZE::VARS_PER_EPAGE + 1) for the labelID For-loop.
            => Querry if GBFile still has enough Bytes left to fill whole page.
                - if not: NumOfLabels = NumberOfRemainingBytes / 3 + 1.

    - Refactor:
        - TinyXML2:
            - Path Traversal:
                - Input a path string to traverse the xml file.
            - Constructor, with LoadFile
            - Add my helper functions to tinyxml2.
                - as wrapper code.
        - Global Definitions should be global somewhere in the project.
        - Write Functions for setting/generating event-commands of different types.
            - makes map code so much better!
    
        - Good way to map Variable names to IDs inside Maker.

    - Problems to Solve:
        - How to handle reads, that are outside of the ROMSIZE Boundary?
            - Can only happen if the .gb code has an error and tries to access memory outside ROM-Boundary.
            - What with 2Byte Reads at the end of ROMSIZE Boundary? First Byte is Valid, but second is not!
            
        - How to handle 2-Byte Read if the ByteOffset is the last Byte of the Event-Page?
            => 1 Byte Memory Overlap. The last Address of that Page returns the first byte of the next page as the second value.
            - e.g. first EPage is responsible for Adresses 0-3000_10 Bytes. If I read first EPage @ 3000 ByteOffset It will return that value and second EPage @ 0 ByteOffset the first value it would have returned.

- sequence:
    - read cartridge header:
        - $0100-$014F
            Entry Point:        4 Bytes     Binary
            Nintendo Logo:      48 Byte     Binary
            Title:              11 Byte     ASCII

            Global Checksum:    2 Byte      Binary
        
        - read ROM-Size and RAM-Size.
        - later: Title (to show in RPG Maker!)
    
    - Create Map File:
        - load map-template

        - add DMG-ROM Event:
            => Create my own DMG-ROM in C-Code similar to Emulator C-Code.
                => good test for emulator.
                => better from a legal standpoint than to use actual DMG-ROM.
                => so this event is different to the other events. Actual logic.
            
            - use event template.
            - Read DMG_ROM.cpp file.
            - use CEC to compile into .xml
            - create an Event to the map with .xml as code.
            
        - add MAP-ROM Events: (Cartridge-ROM)
            - read from actual .gb file (input).
            - use event template.
            - use rom-size:
            - code:
                - Code is binary jump.
                Header:
                    ByteOffset = ByteOffset / BYTES_PER_VAR
                    LabelID = ByteOffset
                    LabelID += 1
                    JumpToLabel VARS_PER_EPAGE / 2;
                Label-Boilerplate:
                    Label X
                    if (LabelID < X)
                        JumpToLabel X - (min(X, 1.000 - X) / 2)
                    if (LabelID > X)
                        JumpToLabel X + (min(X, 1.000 - X) / 2)
                    READVAR1 = LABELXVALUE1
                    READVAR2 = LABELXVALUE2
                    EndEventProcessing


        - add MAP-RAM Events: (DMG-RAM)
            - 500 by 500 map.
            - use event template.
            - Add empty events. Only Thing I need is position.

        - write output .xml file.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into mapfile.

    - Create Maptree File:
        - I think I don't need to change the template. should work like that.
        - if I want to support multiple gameboy games and mapfiles later I might need to change it.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into maptreefile.

    - Create Database File:
        - load database-template.
        
        - add CHARA-RAM:
            - add items:
                - use item template.
                - create 9216 items.
                - item-id defines which item type it is.
            
            - add characters:
                - use character template.
                - create 2966 characters.

        - add EMU Code:
            - load the emu-code .xml (if available)
            - copy:
                common events, switches, variables to database.

        - write output .xml file.

        - call LCF2XML to turn into databasefile.
    
    - Create project folder:
        - folder structure (empty folder):
            - Title, System2, System, Sound, Picture, Panorama, Music, Movie, Monster, GameOver, Frame, FaceSet, ChipSet, CharSet, BattleWeapon, BattleCharSet, Battle2, Battle, Backdrop
        - copy compiled data:
            mapfiles (Map0001.lmu,...), maptree (RPG_RT.lmt), database (RPG_RT.ldb)
        - copy required data:
            RPG_RT.ini, *.r3proj, ultimate_rt_eb.dll, RPT_RT.exe
    
- Code structure:
    - filepaths should be defined in one header file as #define!
    - to have them globally set!
