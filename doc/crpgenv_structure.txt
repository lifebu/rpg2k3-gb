CRPGEnv: C-RPG Maker Environment
    - c-code can be run outside of RPG Maker so that I can debug it normally without dependencies.
        - Plattform Code that runs my code (kinda like engine).


- My C-Code that implements the actual emulator uses a header file (RPGDef.h)
    => THIS IS AN API / INTERFACE.
    - This header declares the functions of the RPG Maker code that I use.
        - Like changeEXP(), setEventLocation().
    - It could also defines the variables and switches with their names. (?)
        - My C-Code should set the names (?)

- The Header is implemented in a Runner
    - Some functions just change the state of the environment.
        - changeExp(), setEventLocation()
        - It has a simplified RPGMaker state representation.
    - Some functions need to do real I/O:
        - 2D-Rendering / Blitting (SDL? SIMPLE OpenGL?)
            - showText(), showChoices(), inputNumber(), showPicture(), 
        - keyInputProcessing()

- simple framework!
