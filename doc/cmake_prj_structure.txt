- CMake problems:   
    - target_compile_features(core PUBLIC cxx_std_17)
        - this should be set globally once for the entire project!    
    
    - I should be able to install the project.
        package/ => don't know about this one. Maybe this is automatically via install?
            the following things need to be in the package:
            - data/ folder and compiled code.
    
    - set warning globally.
        - 

- targets:
    - 


- general makefile for common tasks for the entire project:
    test, docs, install, format

- Add the following tools:
    - Doxygen, fmt, clang-format, clang-tidy, include-what-you-use, valgrind, cpplint, cppcheck, conan, vcpkg, cpm, cmake-format, catch2, ccache.

- Use github actions:
    - give people completed builds they can just download.
    - github pages and documentation (?).
    - unit tests for ubuntu and windows.

- base it on:
