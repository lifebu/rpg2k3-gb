        - \n[n]: Displays the name of the nth actor (n is a number). Supports nested variable references (e.g. "\n[\v[123]]"). Use "\n[0]" to show the name of the first party member.
        - \v[n]: Displays the number in the nth variable (n is a number).
        - \$: Displays the amount of money in possession in an additional window.
        - \!: Temporarily halts text display. When a key is pressed, the next part of the message is displayed.
